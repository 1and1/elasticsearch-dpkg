elasticsearch (1.0.0.RC1-3) wheezy; urgency=low

  * Changed distribution from unstable to wheezy to prevemt lintian error
  * Removed dependency to coreutils because it is an essential class package
    and always installed. This also removes the lintian warning
  * Created an lintian override for postrm-contains-additional-updaterc.d-calls
    because the postrm script stops and removes the service but it is not
    started and installed by the postinst script. At the moment i think this
    behaviour is ok so puppet can install the package and the configuration
    files and then call update-rc and start the service. The lintian override
    script-in-etc-init.d-not-registered-via-update-rc.d addresses the same.
